<p>Patrick Iyere Foundation is set up in memory of Patrick Oriabure Iyere (1968 – 2010) who lost a gallant battle to a heart disease but not without making notable impact in people’s lives, it is that impact that we hope to carry on. </p>
<p>For those who know Patrick well, he had a desire (passion) for helping people, he loved willingly, he gave generously and he served loyally. Patrick had no biases and he was known to reach out to all and dearly loved by all. </p>
